# Close Period Feature Implementation

## Overview

The `close_period` feature adds a first-class "period closed" state to the revenue sharing contract. Once a period is closed by the issuer, no further revenue report overrides are accepted for that period, though claims on already-deposited revenue remain permitted.

**Feature Type:** Issuer-authorized period sealing  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested  
**Test Coverage:** 11 comprehensive tests (100% passing)

---

## Problem Statement

Previously, the contract had no mechanism to prevent revenue report corrections for past periods. This could lead to:
- Unbounded revision of historical data
- Ambiguity about finalized revenue figures for indexers
- Difficulty establishing audit trails for period closure

The `close_period` operation solves this by providing an explicit, irreversible sealing mechanism.

## API Specification

### Core Functions

#### `close_period(issuer, namespace, token, period_id)`

**Purpose:**  
Seals a period, preventing further revenue report overrides while allowing claims on deposited revenue.

**Parameters:**
- `issuer: Address` – The offering's issuer (must authenticate)
- `namespace: Symbol` – The offering namespace
- `token: Address` – The offering token
- `period_id: u64` – The period to seal (must be > 0)

**Returns:**  
`Result<(), RevoraError>`

**Errors:**
- `ContractFrozen` – Contract is frozen
- `ContractPaused` – Contract is paused
- `InvalidPeriodId` – `period_id` is 0
- `OfferingNotFound` – Offering doesn't exist or caller is not the current issuer
- `PeriodAlreadyClosed` – Period has already been sealed

**Events Emitted:**
```
EVENT_PERIOD_CLOSED(issuer, namespace, token)
  data: (period_id: u64, closed_at: u64)
```

#### `is_period_closed(issuer, namespace, token, period_id) → bool`

**Purpose:**  
Query whether a period has been sealed.

**Parameters:**
- `issuer: Address`
- `namespace: Symbol`
- `token: Address`
- `period_id: u64`

**Returns:**  
`bool` – `true` if period is closed, `false` otherwise

---

## Implementation Details

### Storage Model

Closed periods are tracked using a persistent storage flag:

```rust
DataKey2::ClosedPeriod(OfferingId, u64)
  → stored as: closed_at (u64 timestamp)
```

**Why DataKey2?**  
The `DataKey2` enum was introduced to avoid exceeding Soroban's union variant limit. It holds auxiliary/extended contract state.

### Security Checks

#### Authorization
- `issuer.require_auth()` enforces authentication at the Soroban level (host panic on failure)
- Issuer verification via `get_current_issuer()` ensures caller is the legitimate issuer for the offering

#### Input Validation
- `period_id == 0` is rejected (invalid)
- Unknown offering returns `OfferingNotFound` (not `InvalidOffering`)

#### Idempotency
- Closing an already-closed period returns `PeriodAlreadyClosed` (prevents silent double-closes)

### Integration with Revenue Reporting

In `report_revenue()`, when `override_existing == true`:

```rust
let closed_key = DataKey2::ClosedPeriod(offering_id.clone(), period_id);
if env.storage().persistent().has(&closed_key) {
    return Err(RevoraError::PeriodAlreadyClosed);
}
```

**Scope:**  
- ❌ Blocks **overrides** (modifying an existing report)
- ✅ Allows **initial reports** for new periods
- ✅ Allows **deposits** (independent of period closure)
- ✅ Allows **claims** (uses already-deposited revenue)

---

## Test Coverage

### Test Suite: `test_close_period.rs`

All 11 tests pass:

| Test | Scenario | Expected Result |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `close_period_happy_path` | Close an open period | `Ok(())`, `is_period_closed` returns `true` |
| `close_period_emits_event` | Verify event emission | Event emitted with correct data |
| `close_period_double_close_returns_error` | Close already-closed period | `PeriodAlreadyClosed` |
| `close_period_zero_period_id_rejected` | Try to close period 0 | `InvalidPeriodId` |
| `close_period_unknown_offering_returns_not_found` | Close offering that doesn't exist | `OfferingNotFound` |
| `close_period_wrong_issuer_returns_not_found` | Wrong issuer tries to close | `OfferingNotFound` |
| `override_after_close_returns_period_already_closed` | Override after closing | `PeriodAlreadyClosed` |
| `initial_report_for_new_period_after_close_is_allowed` | Report new period after closing old one | Succeeds |
| `deposit_after_close_is_allowed` | Deposit revenue after closing | Succeeds |
| `claim_after_close_is_allowed` | Claim after closing period | Succeeds |
| `close_period_does_not_affect_other_periods` | Closing period 1 doesn't affect period 2 | Period 2 override succeeds |

### Coverage Analysis

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- ✅ Double-close attempt
- ✅ Zero period_id
- ✅ Unknown offering
- ✅ Wrong issuer
- ✅ Override after close
- ✅ Initial report after close
- ✅ Deposit after close
- ✅ Claim after close
- ✅ Period isolation (closing one doesn't affect others)

**Coverage:** 100% of public API, all edge cases exercised

## Error Handling

### Error Codes (Stable Since v1)

| Error | Code | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `PeriodAlreadyClosed` | 48 | Period has been sealed; no further overrides accepted |
| `ReportingWindowClosed` | 25 | Unrelated; prevents reports outside configured window |
| `InvalidPeriodId` | 22 | `period_id` is 0 (invalid) |
| `OfferingNotFound` | 4 | Offering doesn't exist or caller is not issuer |
| `ContractFrozen` | 10 | Contract is frozen |
| `ContractPaused` | 44 | Contract is paused |

### Error Stability

Error code **48** (`PeriodAlreadyClosed`) is **stable** since v1 and will not change. See README.md for full error code table.

---

## Event Specification

### V2 Event Schema

**Symbol:** `per_clos` (8 chars; Soroban requires max 9)

**Topics:**
```
(EVENT_PERIOD_CLOSED, issuer, namespace, token)
```

**Data:**
```
(period_id: u64, closed_at: u64)
```

**Indexer Integration:**  
Indexers can subscribe to the `per_clos` event to detect when periods are sealed. The `closed_at` timestamp provides precise closure timing for audit trails.

---

## Security Assumptions

### Invariants Maintained

1. **Period State Finality**
   - Once closed, a period's override flag cannot be reverted
   - Closed state is permanent and irreversible

2. **Authorization Boundary**
   - Only the current issuer (verified by contract) can close periods
   - Host-level authentication (`require_auth`) enforces this

3. **Independent Axis**
   - Closing a period does **not** prevent:
     - Initial reports for future periods
     - Deposits to any period
     - Claims on deposited revenue
   - This preserves operational flexibility while sealing reporting

4. **No Silent Failures**
   - Double-close attempts return an explicit error
   - Unknown offerings return `OfferingNotFound` (not a default success)

5. **Atomicity**
   - `close_period` writes both the flag and emits an event atomically
   - No partial states possible

---

## Performance Considerations

### Storage I/O

- **Read:** O(1) – Single persistent storage lookup via `has()`
- **Write:** O(1) – Single persistent storage set operation
- **Event Emission:** O(1) – Fixed-size event tuple

### Gas Cost

Closing a period is lightweight:
1. Authorization check (host-level)
2. Offering existence verification (map lookup)
3. Duplicate check (single `has()`)
4. Write closed_at timestamp
5. Event emission

**Total:** ~2–3 storage operations, minimal computation

### Scalability

- No loops over periods
- No cascading state updates
- Per-offering state is independent
- Scales linearly with number of offerings (no quadratic patterns)

---

## Migration Notes

### Backwards Compatibility

- ✅ Existing offerings can adopt `close_period` immediately
- ✅ No state migration required
- ✅ New enum variant `DataKey2::ClosedPeriod` doesn't conflict with prior data
- ✅ Existing revenue reports remain unaffected

### Upgrade Path

1. Deploy updated contract (includes `close_period` feature)
2. Existing issuers continue normal operations
3. Issuers can opt-in to calling `close_period` at their discretion
4. No forced migration or data transformation

---

## Documentation & Examples

### Example Usage

```solidity
// Scenario: Issue has reported revenue for period Q3 2024.
// Now wants to seal it to prevent accidental overwrites.

let issuer = Address::from("G...");
let namespace = symbol_short!("app");
let token = Address::from("C...");
let period_id = 2024_q3;

// 1. Report revenue
client.report_revenue(&issuer, &namespace, &token, &payment_token, &1_000_000, &period_id, &false);

// 2. Later, seal the period
client.close_period(&issuer, &namespace, &token, &period_id)?;

// 3. Verify it's closed
assert!(client.is_period_closed(&issuer, &namespace, &token, &period_id));

// 4. Try to override—rejected
let result = client.try_report_revenue(&issuer, &namespace, &token, &payment_token, &2_000_000, &period_id, &true);
assert_eq!(result, Err(Ok(RevoraError::PeriodAlreadyClosed)));

// 5. But claims still work
let payout = client.claim(&holder, &issuer, &namespace, &token, &10);
assert!(payout > 0);
```

## Read-Only Preflight (`preflight_close_period`, Issue #563)

Operators can preview a close-of-period distribution BEFORE committing,
without mutating state. The preflight surfaces the same precondition chain
as `close_period` (`ContractFrozen`, `ContractPaused`, `InvalidPeriodId`,
`OfferingNotFound`, `PeriodAlreadyClosed`) and returns:

- `period_revenue` — the value currently stored at `DataKey::PeriodRevenue`.
- `class_pay_order` — the canonical class pay order that
  `record_and_emit_pay_order` would write for this period (empty when no
  classes are registered).
- `payouts` — per-holder distribution preview, computed by
  `compute_share(revenue, share_bps, mode)` — the same math
  `simulate_distribution` uses for classless offerings.
- `total_distributed` — saturating sum of `payouts[i].normalized_payout`,
  bounded by `period_revenue`.

#### Signature

```rust
pub fn preflight_close_period(
    env: Env,
    offering_id: OfferingId,
    period_id: u64,
    holders: Vec<Address>,           // caller-supplied (see Scope note)
) -> Result<PreflightCloseResult, RevoraError>
```

The full specification is in [`docs/close-period-preflight.md`](docs/close-period-preflight.md).

#### Scope deviation

The issue's literal text suggested a 2-arg signature. We ship a 3-arg
signature because Soroban persistent maps do not support key iteration and
the closest analogue (`simulate_distribution`) already takes a
caller-supplied holder vector. Indexer/operator flows pass the same holder
set that the eventual `claim()` flow will iterate. Blacklisted addresses
are silently dropped from `payouts` (matching the contract-wide blacklist
precedence rule).

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential future work (not part of v1):

1. **Bulk close** – Close multiple periods in one transaction
2. **Conditional close** – Close period only if conditions met
3. **Reopen** – Allow re-opening closed periods under admin control (rare)
4. **Audit hooks** – Integration with `repair_audit_summary` for closed periods
